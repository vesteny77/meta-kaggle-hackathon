# Meta Kaggle Hackathon

## Overview
This hackathon invites you to dive into the rich tapestry of Meta Kaggle data to uncover insights into the very nature of progress in the ML and AI field.

## Description
For fifteen years, Kaggle’s community has majorly impacted AI and machine learning (ML) progress through Competitions. To inaugurate the launch of Kaggle Hackathons, we’re inviting the community to celebrate these accomplishments in this very hackathon! Very meta. In fact, it’s so meta that your goal will be to use Meta Kaggle & Meta Kaggle Code –datasets about Kaggle– to discover and share insights about how our community has pushed the boundaries of AI.

Inspired by the recognition that Kaggle Competitions represent a gold standard for empirical rigor in AI evaluation, this challenge encourages you to analyze the trends, patterns, and dynamics within this unique ecosystem.The Meta Kaggle and Meta Kaggle Code datasets offer a unique perspective for studying these "gold standard" evaluations. Each competition that Kaggle hosts represents a challenging problem valuable to the larger scientific community. The progress made in these competitions, as visualized by climbing leaderboards, and the vast amounts of metadata surrounding them, offers a unique opportunity to understand how the industry and community have evolved.

## Evaluation
You will submit a writeup to one of the hackathon’s tracks which should minimally include:

1. A high quality writeup covering a paper- or blog-style narrative report of your findings;
Associated reproducible code shared publicly in a Kaggle Notebook;
2. A relevant, high quality YouTube video or interactive demo (e.g., as a walk-through of your Writeup)
3. You may additionally create and attach supporting materials (e.g. external blog posts, supplementary datasets, etc.) to your Writeup as part of your submission.

Submissions to all tracks will be evaluated by a panel of judges with expertise in machine learning competitions and Kaggle data according to the rubric below.

| Description	| Evaluation |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Rules Compliance [yes/no]<br> Writeup follows all instructions and rules | Writeup:<br> - Is relevant to the hackathon track it was submitted to <br> - Contains associated reproducible code publicly shared in a Kaggle Notebook <br> - Contains a YouTube video or interactive demo <br> - Is compliant with hackathon rules, Kaggle Terms of Service, and Community Guidelines |
| Narrative Quality [30pts] <br> The writeup is well written and composed	| Writeup is: <br> - Articulate, concise, accurate, and easy-to-understand <br> - Structured in a clear and accessible way <br> - Code is well documented with markdown and comments |
| Data-Driven Justification [40pts] <br> Use of Meta Kaggle supports conclusions in the writeup	| - Code is reproducible <br> - Insights support the writeup's claims <br> - Effective use of secondary data sources |
| Novelty [30pts] <br> The originality of the submission or findings | - Did the analysis show novelty in its methodology or findings <br> - How creative were the supporting materials (video, interactive demo, etc.) |

You may use external data sources, references, or other resources in your writeup or any supporting materials like notebook analyses.

## FAQ

How do I join Meta Kaggle Code with Meta Kaggle?

> The files contained in Meta Kaggle Code are a subset of the KernelVersions in Meta Kaggle. The file names match the ids in the KernelVersions csv file. Whereas Meta Kaggle contains data for all interactive and commit sessions, Meta Kaggle Code contains only data for commit sessions.

It would be useful if data on XYZ could be added to Meta Kaggle. Can you add it?

> We will occasionally add new fields to Meta Kaggle, but to ensure that everyone participating in this hackathon has fair access to the same data, we won't likely consider making significant changes. If you'd like to request something nonetheless, post your request explaining why it's necessary on the hackathon forums.

I have a question about the Meta Kaggle or Meta Kaggle Code data model

> First, make sure you browse code shared on the Meta Kaggle and Meta Kaggle Code datasets. Someone may have already written code which answers your question.

> Then, ideally you ask on the respective discussion forums for the datasets so that others in the community can learn from the answer. Our team will make a best effort at responding to questions there. You may also use the hackathon forums to ask your question. We recommend making a reproducible Kaggle Notebook and ensuring it's attached to this hackathon to illustrate your question where relevant to further help others learn.
